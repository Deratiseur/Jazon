Jazon is a revenant, a level 8 undead warrior who is very strong and resistant, and once you summon him he follows you around like a familiar.
If he dies, you can recover his heart and summon him again after a rest.
Jazon cannot progress in xp, he will be level 8 forever. He also moves more slowly than the pjs.
There is a 5% chance each time you summon Jazon that he will turn hostile.

To find him, search the tombs. In the Atkatla cemetery in BG2, in the Valley of Shadows in IWDEE. You need to start a new game to find his heart.
